# General guidlines

- if you are adding a new component, make sure to add a folder of that component inside components folder, then create a file index.js where your component code will reside. If the codebase of component is too large, make sure to refactor the code in different files, specifically for each task.

- if you feel that you can create a better structure for the codebase, you are free to go, just raise an issue to discuss on the topic.
